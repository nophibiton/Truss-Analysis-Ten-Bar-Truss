# Truss-Analysis-Ten-Bar-Truss
This is a simple truss analysis using stiffness method on a ten bar truss problem commonly used as a benchmark problem for structural optimization. 
I have made this python code based from my Matlab codes before. This is my first attempt to learn python (specifically for numerical computing).
